This was primarily made by glueing frameworks together, not that proud of it.
I REALLY don't recommend using this, due to the fact that there's probably some horrific security concern in this.

# Installation

If, for whatever reason, you try using this trainwreck:

## Building from source

### Requirements
- A working Rust installation (I'll refer you here: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- If you're on linux you'll have some compilation dependencies. Install them on Debian-based distros through

```
sudo apt install xorg-dev libxcb-composite0-dev
```

Feel free to send any PRs to fix this README, I just wanna move on to something else, man.
